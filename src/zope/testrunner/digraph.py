    A directed graph is a set of nodes together with a

    The class makes intensive use of dicts; therefore, hashability
    is important. Therefore, the class usually does not work
    with the nodes directly but transforms them via
    a ``make_hashable`` function, ``id`` by default.
    This works well for object types where equality is identity.
    For other types, you may need to deactive the transformation
    or use a different ``make_hashable``.
